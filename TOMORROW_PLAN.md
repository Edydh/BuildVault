# BuildVault - Tomorrow's Development Plan 📅
**Date**: September 17, 2025  
**Current Status**: Phase 1 core glass foundations in place

---

## ✅ Today's Accomplishments (September 16, 2025)

### Glass Components & Primitives
- Added `GlassTextInput`, `GlassSwitch`, `GlassFAB`, `GlassModal`, `GlassActionSheet` ✅
- Exported via `components/glass/index.ts` and documented usage ✅

### Screen Integrations
- Projects tab: upgraded “Add Project” to glass FAB ✅
- New Project modal: moved to `GlassModal` and inputs to `GlassTextInput` ✅
- Edit Project modal: centered, polished with `GlassModal` + glass inputs ✅
- Project Detail: camera FAB, Create Folder modal → `GlassModal` ✅

### Action Sheets
- Replaced system alerts with `GlassActionSheet`:
  - Project Options (Edit/Share/Delete) ✅
  - Clear All Data (Settings) ✅
  - Move Media (folder picker) ✅
  - Delete Media confirmation ✅

### Auth Polish
- Legal links simplified to inline hyperlinks; visibility improved ✅

## 🎯 Tomorrow's Priorities (September 17, 2025)

### Priority 1: Glassify Remaining Project Screens
1) Gallery (`app/project/[id]/gallery.tsx`)
   - Add `GlassHeader` with back/toolbar
   - Use `GlassCard` overlays for metadata and counters
   - Hook into `ScrollContext` for fade/translate

2) Media Detail (`app/project/[id]/media/[mediaId].tsx`)
   - Glass top/bottom toolbars (share, delete, info)
   - Use `GlassActionSheet` for actions
   - Ensure video/photo viewer theme contrast

### Priority 2: Consistency & Polish
- Unify FAB spacing across Projects and Project Detail
- Calibrate input focus states (border/cursor) on Android
- Verify safe-area and keyboard avoidance in all modals

### Priority 3: Performance & QA
- Audit blur intensity on Android (prefer darker bg + lower blur)
- Test heavy lists (grid/list) for frame drops
- Add quick perf flag in `GlassThemeProvider` (reduced effects)

### Priority 4: Nice-to-haves (time permitting)
- Convert remaining alerts (Sign Out sheet already routed) and About dialog
- Small haptic cues on action-sheet selections

## 📋 Timeboxed Plan

Morning (9–12)
- Gallery glass header + overlays
- Media Detail toolbars skeleton

Afternoon (1–5)
- Wire `GlassActionSheet` actions, share/delete flows
- Tune Android contrast and performance

Late (5–6)
- QA pass on iOS + Android devices
- Commit, push, and update docs

---

## 📊 Success Criteria
- Gallery and Media Detail use glass components end‑to‑end
- No layout regressions; inputs readable on Android
- 60fps feel on typical devices; no new crashes

---

## 🔎 Risks / Watch‑outs
- Blur + gradients stacking on Android → keep opacity high, blur low
- Keyboard overlap in modals → verify `KeyboardAvoidingView`

---

## 📝 Notes
- Prefer darker backgrounds on Android (`rgba(16,24,38,…)`) with `tint="dark"`
- Use `GlassActionSheet` for all destructive actions going forward
