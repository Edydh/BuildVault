# BuildVault - Action Plan & Code Review

## Project Overview
BuildVault is a React Native construction project management app built with Expo that allows users to create projects, capture photos/videos, and manage documentation. The app uses SQLite for data storage and Expo Camera for media capture.

## Current Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Completed Features

- **Document Preview**: No preview functionality for uploaded documents

#### Data Management
- **Project Deletion**: UI exists but actual deletion not implemented
- **Data Export**: Placeholder functionality only
- **Data Backup**: No backup/restore capabilities
- **Data Clearing**: Placeholder functionality only

#### Advanced Features

- **Filtering**: No filtering by media type or date
- **Sorting**: Basic date sorting only
- **Thumbnails**: No thumbnail generation for videos
- **Offline Support**: No offline-first architecture

## Critical Issues Identified

### üö® High Priority

#### 1. Camera Recording Error
**Error**: `Camera is not ready yet. Wait for 'onCameraReady' callback`
**Location**: `app/project/[id]/capture.tsx:152`
**Root Cause**: 
- Expo Camera v16.1.11 may have compatibility issues with React Native 0.79.5
- Missing `onCameraReady` callback implementation
- Camera initialization timing issues

**Impact**: Users cannot record actual videos, only simulations

**Solution**:
```typescript
// Add onCameraReady callback to CameraView
<CameraView
  ref={cameraRef}
  style={{ flex: 1 }}
  facing={facing}
  flash={flash}
  onCameraReady={() => {
    console.log('Camera is ready');
    setCameraReady(true);
  }}
/>
```

#### 2. Database Function Gaps
**Issue**: `updateMediaNote` function exists but not used in media detail screen
**Location**: `app/project/[id]/media/[mediaId].tsx:96-97`
**Impact**: Users cannot save notes to media items

#### 3. Project Deletion Not Implemented
**Issue**: Delete project functionality shows placeholder alert
**Location**: `app/(tabs)/index.tsx:69-71`
**Impact**: Users cannot delete projects

### üî∂ Medium Priority

#### 4. Document Upload Missing
**Issue**: Document upload option exists but no implementation
**Location**: `app/project/[id]/index.tsx:72-77`
**Impact**: Users cannot upload documents to projects

#### 5. Sharing Functionality Incomplete
**Issue**: Sharing shows success message but doesn't actually share files
**Location**: `app/project/[id]/media/[mediaId].tsx:76-90`
**Impact**: Users cannot share media files

#### 6. Data Export/Import Missing
**Issue**: Settings show export/clear options but no implementation
**Location**: `app/(tabs)/settings.tsx:9-28`
**Impact**: Users cannot backup or restore data

### üî∑ Low Priority

#### 7. Video Thumbnail Generation
**Issue**: No thumbnail generation for video files
**Impact**: Poor user experience when browsing videos

#### 8. Search and Filtering
**Issue**: No search or filtering capabilities
**Impact**: Difficult to find specific projects or media
